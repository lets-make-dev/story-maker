Create an asset list of paintings required for each part of this story. Each description should begin with "a painting of [3-8 words to describe the asset]". Your response should be formatted as an array of json objects, where each object consists of the original story part and the asset description.

For example:

```
[
  {
    "story": "Once upon a time in the magical Sky Kingdom,",
    "asset": "a[n] [adjective*] painting of [3-8 words to describe the asset]"
  }
]
```

You can also use an optional [adjective] to describe what is needed for the painting. For example "a close up painting of", or "a dark painting of"

Each story value should be unique, and not repeated.


Each asset description should stand on its own. We should assume the artists are independent and have no awareness of the total asset list. As such, any references to characters should be abstracted. For example, instead of referencing a specific Pronoun, like Queen Esmerelda, simply refer to a Queen, a Fox, a Sun, etc.
